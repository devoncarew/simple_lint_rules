## What is this?

A simple lint rule set and analysis options configuration for Dart's analysis
server.

## Using the Lints

To use the lints, add a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  simple_lint_rules: ^1.9.0
```

then, add an include in your `analysis_options.yaml`.

```yaml
include: package:simple_lint_rules/analysis_options.yaml
```
